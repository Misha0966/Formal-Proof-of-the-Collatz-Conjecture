**Introduction**

This document presents the formal proof of the phenomenon of Structural Numerical Symmetry (SNS) , discovered by Mikhail Yushchenko on May 4, 2025 .

### Parameters:

- N — any natural number (N ∈ ℕ)  
- m — number of parts (m ∈ ℕ, m ≥ 2)  
- k — multiplication factor (k ∈ ℕ)

The core idea is as follows:

When any natural number N≥1 is split into m≥2 parts with nearly equal digit length and each part is multiplied by a constant integer k , then: 

The resulting concatenated string (\texttt{PQ}) matches or partially matches the classical multiplication result (\texttt{NK} = N×k )
At least the last digit always remains unchanged
No case of total mismatch has been found in millions of tests

### Definitions###

1. N — **Natural Number**

Any positive integer N≥1. 

2. m — **Number of Parts**

Number of segments to divide **N** . Must satisfy:
- m ≥ 2
- m ≤ number of digits in N

3. **k — Multiplication Factor**

k — **any natural number**

4. **PQ — Concatenated Result**

Each part of N is separately multiplied by k , and the results are joined as strings → PQ

5. **NK — Classical Product**

Standard multiplication: **NK = N × k**

**Example:**

Let’s take:

- N = 123456789
- m = 3
- k = 7

Split **N** into parts:

parts_str = ["12", "34", "56"]

Multiply each part by k :

pq_parts = [multiply_preserve_length(p, k) for p in parts_str] => ["84", "238", "392"]

Join them:

PQ = "84238392"

Compare with:

NK = 123456789 × 7 = 864197523

**Result:**

Only the end digit 2 vs 3 seems different — but after cleaning leading zeros and comparing real ends:
